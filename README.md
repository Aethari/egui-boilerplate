# egui Boilerplate Generator
A simple boilerplate generation script for the [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) Rust crate. Creates a `main.rs` file at a given directory. The `main.rs` file contains (will contain?) code that creates a new egui window with a given name and size.

I mostly created this so that I wouldn't have to rewrite the default [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) template code over and over. Maybe it'll help you too :)
